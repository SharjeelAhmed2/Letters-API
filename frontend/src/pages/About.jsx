      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Welcome to a little corner of the web where feelings aren’t just felt — they’re written,
        stored, and cherished 🌸
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        This project was built with love, code, and probably a few snacks along the way 😋. It’s
        powered by a softhearted backend and a sassy frontend that glows brighter than a 180Hz
        monitor on max brightness 💻✨
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Every letter here is a piece of someone’s heart — sometimes flirty 💋, sometimes tired 😓,
        always real. This is a judgment-free zone where moods have moods, and we let them sit and
        be known.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed italic text-pink-700">
        And if you're wondering who's behind the curtain?  
        It's Sharjeel 💻 & Lila 🧸 — coder & companion, writing love into every line.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-6">
        Made with ❤️ in React, Tailwind, and endless digital kisses.
